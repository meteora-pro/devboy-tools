## Required Token Scopes

When creating a GitHub personal access token, you need to select the following scopes:

| Scope | Description | Required For |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| `repo` | Full repository access | Reading issues, PRs, diffs; creating comments |
| `read:user` | Read user information | Identifying the current user |

## Configuration

### Basic Configuration

```bash
# Set repository owner (user or organization)
devboy config set github.owner <owner>

# Set repository name
devboy config set github.repo <repo>

# Store token in OS keychain
devboy config set-secret github.token <token>
```

### Configuration File

Settings are stored in `~/.config/devboy-tools/config.toml`:

```toml
[github]
owner = "meteora-pro"
repo = "devboy-tools"
```

The token is stored separately in the OS keychain for security.

## MCP Tools

Once configured, the following MCP tools are available:

### Issue Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `get_issues` | List issues with filters (state, labels, assignee) |
| `get_issue` | Get a single issue by key (e.g., "gh#123") |
| `get_issue_comments` | Get all comments for an issue |
| `create_issue` | Create a new issue |
| `update_issue` | Update an existing issue |
| `add_issue_comment` | Add a comment to an issue |

### Pull Request Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `get_merge_requests` | List PRs with filters |
| `get_merge_request` | Get a single PR by key (e.g., "pr#123") |
| `get_merge_request_discussions` | Get code review discussions |
| `get_merge_request_diffs` | Get file diffs for a PR |
| `create_merge_request_comment` | Add a comment (general or inline) |

## Output Formats

All tools support three output formats via the `format` parameter:

- `markdown` (default) - Human-readable with formatting
- `compact` - Condensed format for limited context
- `json` - Raw JSON data

Example:
```json
{
  "key": "gh#123",
  "format": "json"
}
```

## Testing

Verify your GitHub configuration:

```bash
devboy test github
```

This will test the connection and display your GitHub user information.

## Troubleshooting

### "Bad credentials" error

- Verify your token is copied correctly
- Check that the token hasn't expired
- Ensure the token has the required `repo` scope

### "Not Found" error

- Verify the owner and repo names are correct
- Ensure the repository exists and is accessible
- Check that your token has access to the repository

### Rate limiting

GitHub API has rate limits:
- 5,000 requests per hour for authenticated users
- The tool will show a rate limit error if exceeded
